# HackerRank_Problem-Words_Score
Problem: Consider that vowels in the alphabet are a, e, i, o, u and y.
Given a list of words prompted from the user, the score is calculated as follows:
The score of a single word is "2" if the word contains an even number of vowels. Otherwise, the score of this word is "1". 
The score for the whole list of words is the sum of scores of all words in the list.
